## User README

Our controller app is a desktop app that is both MacOSX and Windows compatible. The car may be controlled via keyboard, or by mouse-click with the buttons provided on the UI. The UI is fairly intuitive. The 'W' key provides forward acceleration; with press of the accelerate button, the speed will be increased by 1 unit. Similarly, the 'S' key provides deceleration, or reverse control. Each press of the deccelerate key will decrease the speed by 1 unit. 

'A' and 'D' keys turn the car left and right, respectively. Toggling the motor on and off is done with the SPACE BAR.
